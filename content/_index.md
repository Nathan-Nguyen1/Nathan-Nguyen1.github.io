description: Welcome! <br><br> This site is a work in progress, so you'll find that it's sparse with not much content. I'm hoping to push some small R/Python projects and tutorials over time. <br><br> I'm currently doing analytics work in higher education, and before that I was doing COVID-19 vaccine analytics work at a health department.
